different types of error

2. Expected Errors
-file can't be read database operation fails
-inform user, possibly retry.

3. Bugs/Logical Errors

-fix during development.

Working with Errors
Error is thrown
error is a technical object in a node application
there is a error object that we can thrown.

synchronous code (code execute line by line, when we dont interact wit files or dont send request.)  - try-catch block
asynchronouse (readfile, interact to database) code - then-catch. catch executed with any error in the then blocks.

No error is thrown
we just have to check the values with if checks and decide wheather we want to throw an error.
or directly handle the error.
